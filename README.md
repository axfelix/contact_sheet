# Contact Sheet

Command line script to convert a folder of image files into a labelled contact sheet document. 

Before running the script, either save the py file in the same folder as the images to be processed or ensure that the working directory in the command line is the image folder.

Number of columns for contact sheet grid is defaulted to five. Edit script to change if needed.
